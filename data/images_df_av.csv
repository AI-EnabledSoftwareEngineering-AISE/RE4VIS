NACA Ice wind tunnel used by Rodert Collection NASA Image eXchange Collection Title TwoDimensional LowTurbulence Tunnel Description Construction of the wood frame for the TwoDimensional LowTurbulence Tunnel The TwoDimensional LowTurbulence Tunnel was originally called the Refrigeration or Ice tunnel because it was intended to support research on aircraft icing The tunnel was built of wood lined with sheet steel and heavily insulated on the outside Refrigeration equipment was installed to generate icing conditions inside the test section The NACA sent out a questionnaire to airline operators asking them to detail the specific kinds of icing problems they encountered in flight The replies became the basis for a comprehensive research program begun in 1938 when the tunnel commenced operation Research quickly focused on the concept of using exhaust heat to prevent ice from forming on the wings leading edge This project was led by Lewis Rodert who later would win the Collier Trophy for his work on deicing By 1940 aircraft icing research had shifted to the new Ames Research Laboratory and the Ice tunnel was refitted with screens and honeycomb Researchers were trying to eliminate all turbulence in the test section From TN 1283 The Langley twodimensional lowturbulence pressure tunnel is a singlereturn closedthroat tunnel The tunnel is constructed of heavy steel plate so that the pressure of the air may be varied from approximately full vacuum to 10 atmospheres absolute thereby giving a wide range of air densities Reciprocating compressors with a capacity of 1200 cubic feet of free air per minute provide compressed air Since the tunnel shell has a volume of about 83000 cubic feet a compression rate of approximately one atmosphere per hour is obtained  The test section is rectangular in shape 3 feet wide 7 12 feet high and 7 12 feet long  The overall size of the windtunnel shell is about 146 feet long and 58 feet wide with a maximum diameter of 26 feet The test section and entrance and exit cones are surrounded by a 22foot diameter section of the shell to provide a space to house much of the essential equipment Date 02041938 Credit NASA Langley Research Center NASALaRC  lisarlarcnasagov  ID EL199900646 Other ID L148453 UID SPDNIXEL19990064 6 Original url nixkscnasagovinfoidEL199900646amporgid1 SOURCE nasaimagesorglunaservletdetailnasaNAS2213192115410 Visit wwwnasaimagesorg for the most comprehensive compilation of NASA stills film and video created in partnership with Internet Archive,/home/hamed/projects/av_all/images/565.jpg,https://aise.blob.core.windows.net/aise1/565.jpg,-1

 This is the sole surviving fighter from the Polish Air Force of 1939 The P11c was the main production variant of the 325 built Polish serial 863 cn 562 It is now on display taking pride of place in the new entrance building at the Muzeum Lotnictwa Polskiego Krakow Poland 2382013 The following info is taken from the museums website In the last months of 1927 the Department of Aeronautics commissioned to the Central Aviation Works which were renamed the State Aviation Works in 1928 the design of a fighter which could be a follower of the commonly used SPAD aircraft The work over the new airframe was started by Zygmunt Puławski The first from the family of Puławski aircraft drew international attention Next came the P6 and the P7 Again both arose interest in foreign constructors and were awarded at the international air shows In 1930 the Department of Aeronautics commanded to design a predecessor for the P6 and the P7 The new P11 fighter was a single seat all metal upper wing aeroplane with fixed undercarriage The aircraft featured original technical and technological solutions The first was the Wibault metal corrugated skin covered wing having an unusual shape and construction enabling to gain low weight high durability good aerodynamics features and an excellent front and side visibility This unconventional solution called abroad the Polish wing or Puławskis wing gave a gull wing shape to the wings Another feature was a scissors type undercarriage with shock absorbers buried inside the fuselage Worth mentioning was also the semi  monocoque fuselage construction used earlier in the P7 fighter and dropped in case of fire the main fuel tank The work of Zygmunt Puławski who died while test flying his new construction was continued by Wsiewołod Jakimiuk The prototype of the P11 was test flown in 1931 by Bolesław Orliński Displayed in 1934 at the Paris Air Show it aroused big interest among specialists A technologically advanced contemporary construction it possessed excellent flying characteristics and a formidable performance Fifty of the P11a were produced for the Polish Air Force and fifty of the P11b powered with the GnomeRhone 9K engine for export to Romania The PZL P11c powered with the Mercury IV S2 engine flew for the first time in summer 1934 In comparison with earlier versions it featured an improved flight stability better cockpit visibility and increased fire power In total 175 P11c fighters were built in Poland Tests with naval winter with skis and dive bombing versions were also carried out but didnt come beyond the study phase The engine was then changed for the GnomeRhone Mistral The aircraft in this configuration served as the sample for the licence built P11f Seventy aircraft of that version were produced at the Romanian IAR Works In autumn 1936 the Spanish republican government made efforts to buy 36 airframes but because of the Polish declaration of neutrality this transaction was not finalised The followed type the P24 was the last of the family of these aircraft Armed with two cannons and two machine guns it was considered as the fighter with the biggest fire power then In 1937 with the introduction into service in other countries of the more modern low wing fighters the P11 became obsolete The PZL P11c was a basic fighter in service with the Polish Air Force in September 1939 It gave way to the new generation of aircraft as the German Bf109 was However thanks to the skills of the Polish pilots the eleveners scored 120 enemy aircraft to their credit The exhibit on display flew with the 121st Flight of the 2nd Air Regiment in Krakow Today this aircraft is considered as the most precious exhibit at the Polish Aviation Museum but not because of the material value It is the only saved Polish fighter from the September 1939 campaign the symbol of the Polands lone struggle with the German Luftwaffe,/home/hamed/projects/av_all/images/3972.jpg,https://aise.blob.core.windows.net/aise1/3972.jpg,4
