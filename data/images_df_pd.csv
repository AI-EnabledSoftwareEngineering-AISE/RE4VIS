 English By March 2008 the crisscross yellow box junctions were fading outside all three entrances to Arrivas bus garage in Philip Lane Tottenham N15 Including the curvedroof building on the left of the photo  Second in a series of five photos about two unlawful yellow box junctions outside the Arriva bus garage in Philip Lane N15   First  Next   Last    Before May 2006 these road markings were enforced by Haringey Council using closed circuit cameras CCTV and by Penalty Charge Notices  PCNs Tickets or fines A total of 3746 PCNs were issued to drivers stopping in or partly in the box junctions I listed the monthly figures below the previous photo here In 2008 former councillor Ray Dodds made Freedom of Information Act FoI requests about these road markings and fines on motorists The answers from Haringey Parking Service revealed that the validity of the yellow boxes had been raised internally by Haringey staff two years earlier  on 2 March 2006 On 14 March 2006 it was confirmed that the box junctions did not comply with the regulations set by the Department for Transport DfT In other words they were unlawful Despite knowing this Haringey officers continued to issue a few PCNs fines I was later told that in April and May 2006 officers acted contrary to instructions Whilst We Seek Authorisation On 3 March 2008 Haringey Parking Service wrote to Ray Dodds telling him We have however left the box marking on site as it acts as a deterrent for vehicles obstructing access to the bus garage whilst we seek authorisation from DfT to legally enforce markings Their email to Ray seems to suggest that having confirmed in March 2006 that the two boxes did not comply with Statutory Regulations theyd left them there for the time being while they tried to rectify the position How By getting the Department for Transport to authorise the boxes retrospectively So when did Haringeys Environment Department actually seek authorisation Ray Dodds and I uncovered that  Haringey staff didnt contact the DfT immediately after 2 March 2006 even though they had a pretty good idea that the yellow box junctions were unlawful  Nor was it shortly after 14 March 2006 when they confirmed that the boxes were unlawful In fact Haringey did not make this request to the Department for Transport until Tuesday 26 February 2008  almost two years later And this was apparently only after Ray Dodds had raised the issue with Haringey officers In letters we later obtained under the Freedom of Information Act Ray Dodds and I uncovered that unlike Haringey Parking Service the Department for Transport did not drag its feet The DfT replied to Haringey very speedily indeed On 6 March 2008 John Munns from the DfT Traffic Signs Policy replied that they could not authorise these yellow box junctions Haringey received his reply on 7 March 2008 What Mr John Munns wrote to Haringey Thank you for your letter of 26 February 2008 concerning yellow box junctions on Philip Lane at entrances to Tottenham Bus garage I regret that we cannot authorise these yellow boxes Even if yellow boxes which wholly comply with diagrams 12043 or 1044 in the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2002 are placed in the road they are also subject to Schedule 19 part 2 on page 411 of TSRGD 2002 This defines a box junction and included in the definition that it is at the junction of two or more roads We do not have powers to amend this definition without Parliamentary process Whilst Philip Lane is certainly a road we doubt that the two entrances to Tottenham Bus Garage would qualify as roads I am aware at certain sites in London where yellow boxes have been placed at entrances to fire stations hospitals bus stations and similar places Unless such boxes are placed at actual junctions of roads all such boxes may be vulnerable to challenge when enforcement action is taken Authorisation of such road markings will not alter the legal position I am sorry especially on this occasion that we cannot be more helpful You may wish to resort to a road marking to diagram 1026 In the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2002  To recap heres the sequence  2 March 2006  doubts about the the validity of the yellow boxes are raised internally by Haringey staff In other words they doubted whether they were able to legally enforce markings  ie fine motorists by issuing PCNs  14 March 2006  Haringey confirm that the two yellow box junctions do not comply with the Statutory Regulations  Tuesday 26 February 2008 Haringey write to the Department for Transport DfT requesting them to authorise these two yellow box junctions  Monday 3 March 2008 Haringey Parking Service write to Cllr Ray Dodds  Thursday 6 March 2008 John Munns at the Department for Transport DfT writes to Haringey refusing to authorise the boxes  Friday 7 March 2008 Haringey receives the DfT reply Why is this time sequence important Because It shows that when Haringey Parking Service wrote to Ray Dodds on 3 March 2008 they omitted to mention that theyd only written to the DfT on this matter six days before Then only four days later when they got Mr Munns negative reply they failed to pass this key piece of information to Ray Dodds This was despite the fact that he was the councillor who raised the issue At the time Ray also represented Bruce Grove ward where the bus garage and yellow box junctions are situated Later when refusing to refund any of the money paid by motorists on these unlawful box junctions Haringey claimed that it had been acting in good faith when it sent out the fines Would a reasonable observer have found much acting in good faith in the sequence of events we uncovered Ray Dodds and I found none whatsoever  Click here  to read the next
